# Full Stack Developer

My name is Axel and I am currently enrolled in a full stack coding bootcamp at the University of Washington. Programming has been a lifelong hobby of mine and I am excited to combine that with my previous work experiences on -- then leading -- a team, to make a fruitful career change.

What excites me the most with coding is the aspect of solving a puzzle. I am very perceptive with details and possess a strong understanding of the concepts of programming. My biggest strengths lie in backend work, however I also been transferring those skills to my frontend work to match.
